# How to "Bump"

## What This Is
A simple way to accommodate delays while encouraging good use of time that might be lost to that delay.

## The Problem
Everybody is late sometimes. 

Things happen, tires get flats, babies barf, and internet connectivity goes out. So, sometimes a scheduled event gets a delayed or even needs to be fully rescheduled. It happens. 

Unfortunately, a Late Person often *can't* provide an exact time when they know conclusively that the cause of their tardiness will be resolved. Or, candidly, maybe they're just not very good at estimating how long things take. Most of us are terrible at this.

This tends to present through familiar updates like "I just need a minute" which might become "I just need 10 minutes" or the perennial "I swear I'm almost ready!" etc.

In any case, their colleague may find themselves stuck in an awkward and frustrating liminal state: "Well, what should I *do* now?"

In particular, if the estimated time of resumption becomes a rolling "Just five more minutes please!" they will be understandably reluctant to formally switch out of "Waiting Mode" in order to  dynamically redeploy their time to something more useful thanâ€¦just waiting. Why start working on something substantial if you know you may be interrupted any second?


## The Basic Idea
When a participant in a remote call or meeting is going to be late for the scheduled start time, one or more of the affected participants can ask for a "bump."

## Example

1. Call Participant #1 ("Alice") is running late for a call
2. Alice alerts Call Participant #2 ("Bob") about the delay
3. Bob asks Alice for a "Bump plus 15"
3. When Alice is ready to go, they text Bob "BUMP!"
